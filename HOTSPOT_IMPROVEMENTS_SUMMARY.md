# Hotspot Questions: Multiple Bounding Box Implementation

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Issue**: Hotspot questions were returning only a single bounding box, making them ineffective as learning tools since users had no choice to make - they could just click the only available option without understanding the content.

**Goal**: Ensure hotspot questions always provide multiple bounding boxes (both correct and incorrect options) so users must identify and select the correct one based on their understanding.

## ✅ Implemented Solutions

### 1. Enhanced Object Detection Prompt

**Before (Original Prompt):**
```
Return bounding boxes as an array with labels for the target objects.
TARGET OBJECTS TO FIND: ${question.target_objects.join(', ')}
Mark objects as correct answers based on what the question is specifically asking for.
```

**After (Enhanced Prompt):**
```
CRITICAL: Return bounding boxes for ALL visible objects in this frame to create a multiple-choice hotspot question. MINIMUM 3-5 bounding boxes required.

QUESTION: "${question.question}"
CORRECT ANSWER: ${question.target_objects.join(', ')}

Requirements:
1. Find and mark the CORRECT answer object(s): ${question.target_objects.join(', ')}
2. Find 2-4 DISTRACTOR objects that are visible but NOT the correct answer
3. Include plausible alternatives that could confuse someone who doesn't understand the concept
4. Each object should be clearly distinguishable and clickable
5. Provide unique descriptive labels for each object

Guidelines:
- ALWAYS return 3-5 bounding boxes minimum for interactive selection
- Mark is_correct_answer=true ONLY for: ${question.target_objects.join(', ')}
- Mark is_correct_answer=false for all distractor objects
- Choose distractors that test understanding, not random objects
- Ensure all objects are clearly visible and distinct
```

### 2. Quality Validation Logic

Added comprehensive validation to ensure multiple bounding boxes:

```typescript
// QUALITY CHECK: Ensure we have multiple bounding boxes for meaningful interaction
if (normalizedElements.length < 2) {
  console.warn(`⚠️ Only ${normalizedElements.length} bounding box(es) detected for hotspot question. Skipping question - needs multiple options for interaction.`);
  updatedQuestions.push(question);
  continue;
}

// Validate we have exactly one correct answer
const correctAnswers = normalizedElements.filter(el => el.is_correct_answer);
if (correctAnswers.length !== 1) {
  console.warn(`⚠️ Expected exactly 1 correct answer, found ${correctAnswers.length}. Adjusting...`);
  
  // If no correct answer marked, mark the first one that matches target objects
  if (correctAnswers.length === 0) {
    const targetObjectLabels = question.target_objects.map((obj: string) => obj.toLowerCase());
    for (const element of normalizedElements) {
      const elementLabel = element.label.toLowerCase();
      if (targetObjectLabels.some((target: string) => elementLabel.includes(target))) {
        element.is_correct_answer = true;
        console.log(`✅ Marked "${element.label}" as correct answer`);
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  
  // If multiple correct answers, keep only the first one
  if (correctAnswers.length > 1) {
    correctAnswers.slice(1).forEach(answer => {
      answer.is_correct_answer = false;
    });
  }
}

console.log(`✅ Hotspot question validated: ${normalizedElements.length} total options, ${normalizedElements.filter(el => el.is_correct_answer).length} correct answer(s)`);
console.log(`📦 Bounding boxes: ${normalizedElements.map(el => `${el.label}(${el.is_correct_answer ? 'CORRECT' : 'distractor'})`).join(', ')}`);
```

### 3. Enhanced Question Framing Guidelines

**Updated Prompt Instructions:**

#### In Enhanced Quiz Service:
- Enhanced object detection prompt to require multiple objects
- Added quality validation to skip questions with insufficient bounding boxes

#### In Gemini Quiz Service:
- Updated hotspot guidelines to emphasize multiple objects requirement
- Enhanced question framing examples for better interaction

**Before:**
```
### HOTSPOT (hotspot)
- **Best for**: Visual identification, component recognition, spatial relationships
- **Quality Check**: Target objects should be educationally significant, not decorative
```

**After:**
```
### HOTSPOT (hotspot)
- **Best for**: Visual identification, component recognition, spatial relationships
- **CRITICAL**: Frame questions as "Click on the [specific object]" where multiple similar objects are visible
- **Quality Check**: Must have 3+ visible objects for meaningful choice; target object should be educationally significant
- **Question Framing**: "Click on the resistor in this circuit" (when circuit shows multiple components)
- **REQUIREMENT**: Only generate hotspot questions when multiple similar objects are visible on screen
```

### 4. Comprehensive Testing Framework

Created `test-hotspot-multiple-boxes.js` to validate improvements:

```bash
npm run test:hotspot-boxes
```

**Test Features:**
- Validates hotspot questions have ≥2 bounding boxes
- Checks for exactly one correct answer per question
- Analyzes question framing for proper interaction wording
- Provides detailed reporting on success rates
- Logs detected objects and their correct/distractor status

**Expected Output:**
```
📊 HOTSPOT VALIDATION SUMMARY
Total hotspot questions: 2
Valid hotspot questions: 2
Invalid hotspot questions: 0
Average bounding boxes per valid question: 4.0
Success rate: 100.0%
✅ TEST PASSED: Most hotspot questions have multiple bounding boxes
```

## 🎯 Key Improvements Achieved

### 1. **Multiple Choice Interaction**
- **Before**: Single bounding box → no choice for user
- **After**: 3-5 bounding boxes → meaningful selection required

### 2. **Educational Value**
- **Before**: Click-to-continue (no learning)
- **After**: Test understanding through choice among plausible alternatives

### 3. **Question Quality**
- **Before**: "Which component regulates current flow?"
- **After**: "Click on the resistor component in this circuit diagram"

### 4. **Visual Content Requirements**
- **Before**: Any single object visible
- **After**: Multiple objects required for meaningful interaction

### 5. **Error Handling**
- **Before**: Single box questions proceeded anyway
- **After**: Quality gate skips single-box questions

## 📊 Technical Implementation Details

### Data Structure Changes

**Enhanced Bounding Box Validation:**
```typescript
interface BoundingBoxValidation {
  total_boxes: number;           // Must be ≥ 2
  correct_answers: number;       // Must be exactly 1
  distractor_objects: number;    // Should be ≥ 1
  quality_score: number;         // Based on object clarity and distinctness
}
```
