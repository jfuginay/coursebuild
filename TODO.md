### Active Issues 🔄

- [x] **High Priority**: Question overlay persists when resuming video playback [FIXED]
  - When a question appears and user answers it, then clicks play on YouTube video itself
  - Expected: Question overlay should disappear and return to transcript view
  - Actual: Question remains visible below while video continues playing
  - Also causes video to not pause at next question timestamp
  - Works correctly when using "Continue Watching" button on the question itself
  - Fix implemented: 
    - Hide question overlay when video resumed via YouTube controls
    - Added "Skip Question" button for users who want to continue without answering
    - YouTube player controls are now disabled when a question is showing
    - Users must either answer or skip the question to continue
    - Skipped questions are tracked in database with is_skipped=true and is_correct=NULL
    - Created migration 007_add_skip_tracking.sql to add skip tracking support

- [ ] **Critical Priority**: Authentication bypass in course completion flow
  - Unauthenticated users can complete entire courses without login
  - Expected: Login modal after first 2 questions, video progression blocked
  - Actual: Users can complete course and reach certificate generation
  - Results in 404 error (DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND) on certificate page
  - Production URL affected: coursebuild.org
  - Error code: `clei:2sllt-1752164360069-46741f262689`
