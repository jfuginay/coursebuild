### Common Query Patterns

#### Getting Course with Transcript Data
```javascript
// ⚠️ Note: video_transcripts returns as an array!
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('courses')
  .select(`
    *,
    video_transcripts (
      video_summary,
      key_concepts_timeline
    )
  `)
  .eq('id', courseId)
  .single();

// Handle the array response
const transcript = data.video_transcripts?.[0] || null;
```

#### Getting User's Wrong Questions
```javascript
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('user_question_responses')
  .select(`
    *,
    questions!inner(
      question,
      type,
      options,
      correct_answer,
      explanation
    )
  `)
  .eq('user_id', userId)
  .eq('is_correct', false)
  .order('attempted_at', { ascending: false });
```

### Key Relationships & Gotchas

1. **Video Transcripts Join**: Always returns an array, even for single results
2. **Question Types**: Different types store answers differently:
   - MCQ/TF: `selected_answer` is index, `response_text` is actual text
   - Hotspot: `response_text` contains clicked element and coordinates
   - Matching/Sequencing: Complex JSON in `response_text`
3. **Session Data**: Anonymous users tracked in localStorage, not database
4. **Segmented Processing**: Each segment can have its own transcript entry
5. **Profile Confidence**: Increases with more user data (capped at 1.0)

- **Export & Sharing Features**: One-click code copying, SVG downloads, and note-saving functionality
- **Production Ready**: Deployed `ai-chat-assistant` edge function with LangSmith integration for monitoring

### Complete Hotspot Metadata Fix for Segmented Processing (December 2024)
- **Fixed Missing Metadata**: Segmented video processing now saves ALL hotspot metadata fields
- **Added Bounding Box Storage**: Both in metadata `detected_elements` field and separate `bounding_boxes` table
- **Complete Feature Parity**: Segmented processing now identical to non-segmented for hotspot questions
- **Fields Now Properly Saved**:
  - `frame_timestamp` - Precise video frame timing
  - `distractor_guidance` - Educational distractor information
  - `detected_elements` - All bounding boxes with coordinates
  - `gemini_bounding_boxes` - Indicates Gemini Vision processing
  - `video_dimensions` - Video dimension reference

### OpenAI as Default Provider for Text Questions (December 2024)
- **Changed Default Provider**: All text-based questions now use OpenAI GPT-4o by default
- **Updated Question Types**:
  - Multiple Choice: `preferredProvider: 'openai'`
  - True/False: `preferredProvider: 'openai'`
  - Matching: `preferredProvider: 'openai'`
  - Sequencing: `preferredProvider: 'openai'`
- **Maintained Fallback**: Gemini still serves as automatic fallback if OpenAI fails
- **Visual Questions Unchanged**: Hotspot questions continue using Gemini Vision API

### Robust Segmented Processing Architecture (December 2024)
- **Atomic Segment Processing**: Prevents concurrent processing with worker IDs and conditional database updates
- **Backend Orchestrator**: New `orchestrate-segment-processing` function manages all segment processing
- **Sequential Guarantee**: Segments process in order with enforced dependency checking
- **No Frontend Coupling**: All orchestration happens in backend - works even if browser closes
- **Automatic Recovery**: 5-minute timeout detection with automatic retry
- **Database Enhancements**:
  - Added `worker_id` column for processing locks
  - Added `retry_count` for failure tracking
  - Optimized indexes for stuck segment queries
- **LangSmith Integration**: All Gemini API calls now logged for debugging and monitoring
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when database columns don't exist
- See `SEGMENTED_PROCESSING_ARCHITECTURE.md` for complete details

### Video Segmenting Implementation - Complete
- **Automatic Video Segmentation**: Videos >10 minutes automatically split into ~5-minute segments to avoid Edge Function timeouts
- **Context Management System**:
  - `SegmentContext` preserves educational continuity between segments
  - Tracks key concepts, previous questions, and transcript segments
  - Cumulative context passed between segments for coherent question generation
- **Smart Segment Boundaries**:
  - 5-second buffer added to video clips to avoid cutting mid-sentence
  - Last segment <20 seconds automatically merged with previous
  - Empty transcript segments skip question generation
- **Enhanced Timestamp Handling**:
  - Added `timestamp_format` field to Gemini responses
  - Support for multiple formats: seconds, base60, mm:ss, decimal_minutes
  - Intelligent format detection and conversion
- **Progressive Transcript Building**:
  - Single transcript entry built progressively across all segments
  - Proper handling of segment boundaries and timestamp continuity

### Timestamp Conversion Fix
- **Fixed decimal minute format**: Timestamps like 3.37 now correctly convert to 3m 37s (217 seconds)
- **Issue**: Videos showing incorrect duration (e.g., 3.2s instead of 3:37)
- **Solution**: Enhanced `convertBase60ToSeconds` to detect and handle decimal minute format
- **Also supports**: String timestamps in "MM:SS" or "H:MM:SS" format

### Segmented Video Processing Fix
- **Fixed incorrect filtering**: Removed double-filtering of Gemini's video segment output
- **Issue**: Code was filtering transcript/questions after Gemini already clipped the video with startOffset/endOffset
- **Solution**: Trust Gemini's output when video clipping is used - timestamps are absolute but content is already scoped
- **Result**: Segmented and full video processing now produce consistent, accurate results
- See `SEGMENTED_PROCESSING_DEBUG.md` for detailed analysis

### Video Segmentation Improvements
- **Smart Last Segment Handling**: If the last segment is less than 20 seconds, it's automatically merged with the previous segment to avoid tiny segments
- **Empty Transcript Handling**: Segments with no transcript content (e.g., intro/outro music) skip question generation automatically
- **5-Second Buffer**: Video segments include a 5-second buffer at the end to avoid cutting off mid-sentence
  - Buffer is applied to `endOffset` when calling Gemini API
  - Gemini returns only content from the clipped segment (no additional filtering needed)
  - No buffer applied to the last segment

### Automatic Video Segmentation for Long Videos (NEW)
- **Automatic Segmentation**: Videos longer than 10 minutes are automatically split into ~5-minute segments
- **Sequential Processing**: Segments are processed one by one to avoid Edge Function timeouts
- **Context Continuity**: Each segment receives comprehensive context from previous segments:
  - Last 2 minutes of transcript from previous segment
  - All key concepts introduced so far
  - Summary of recent questions asked
  - Cumulative educational progression
- **Smart Segment Boundaries**: Segments use video clipping with `startOffset`/`endOffset` for precise content
- **Progressive Transcript Building**: Single transcript entry built progressively across all segments
- **Automatic Chaining**: Each segment automatically triggers the next upon completion

### Progress Tracking Table Fix
- Fixed incorrect table names in progress tracking system
- Changed `processing_progress` → `quiz_generation_progress` 
- Changed `details` column → `metadata` column
- Commented out individual question progress tracking (table doesn't exist yet)

### Dynamic Frame Sampling Based on Video Duration
- The system now dynamically adjusts frame sampling rates based on video duration
- Instead of using a fixed 1fps sampling rate, we use:
  - **Constant 300 frames** per video regardless of duration
  - Ensures consistent Gemini API usage across all videos
  - Better coverage for short videos, efficient processing for long videos
