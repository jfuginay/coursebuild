# Video Transcript Data Fix - Deployment Checklist

## Overview
This fix addresses two issues with the enhanced recommendations system:
1. **Accuracy Display Issue**: Anonymous users showing "6667%" instead of "66.67%" accuracy
2. **Transcript Data Loading**: Video summaries and key concepts not being loaded from the database

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Accuracy Conversion (Line 1532)
**File**: `supabase/functions/enhanced-recommendations/index.ts`
```typescript
// Before:
overall_accuracy: performance.accuracy,

// After:
overall_accuracy: performance.accuracy / 100, // Convert percentage to decimal
```

### 2. Fixed Video Transcript Join Handling (Lines 1417-1458)
**File**: `supabase/functions/enhanced-recommendations/index.ts`
- Updated `getCourseContext` to handle array response from `video_transcripts` join
- Added proper null checking and array handling
- Normalized the transcript data structure for consistent access

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Enhanced Recommendations Edge Function
```bash
cd supabase
npx supabase functions deploy enhanced-recommendations --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

### 2. Verify Deployment
```bash
# Test with a course that has transcript data
node scripts/test-transcript-based-recommendations.js
```

### 3. Expected Results
- Accuracy should display correctly (e.g., "67%" not "6667%")
- Video summaries should load from `video_transcripts` table
- Key concepts should be extracted and displayed
- Graceful fallback for courses without transcript data

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Anonymous user recommendations show correct accuracy percentage
- [ ] Video summary appears in recommendation prompts (not default description)
- [ ] Key concepts are extracted and shown in recommendations
- [ ] Courses without transcripts still work (with fallback to description)
- [ ] No errors in Edge Function logs

## Diagnostic Tools

1. **Check Video Transcript Data**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/check-video-transcript-data.js
   ```

2. **Test Anonymous Recommendations**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-anonymous-recommendations.js
   ```

3. **Test Transcript-Based Recommendations**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-transcript-based-recommendations.js
   ```

## Notes

- Transcripts are only available for courses generated with `quiz-generation-v5` or later
- Older courses will use the course description as fallback
- The fix handles both single transcript and array responses from Supabase joins
