# Enhanced Recommendations: Wrong Questions Display Fix

## Summary
Fixed the enhanced recommendations system to properly display user wrong answers in recommendation prompts, ensuring the AI has full context about user mistakes when suggesting next videos.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Query Fixes
- Fixed `getUserPerformanceData` to use `attempted_at` instead of `created_at` for ordering
- Fixed `getWrongQuestionsFromCourse` to use the same column
- Added comprehensive logging to debug wrong question retrieval

### 2. User Answer Storage Verification
The system correctly stores user answers in two fields:
- `response_text`: Stores string answers like "True", "Light Color Setting", matching responses
- `selected_answer`: Stores numeric indices for backward compatibility

### 3. Enhanced Display for Special Question Types

#### Multiple Choice Questions
- Shows all options with checkmarks for correct answer
- Indicates which option the user selected
- Example:
  ```
  Options:
    1. Color Temperature
    2. Color Temperature Compensation ✓ (correct)
    3. Light Color Setting ← (user selected)
    4. White Balance
  ```

#### Matching Questions
- Shows the correct matching pairs
- Indicates user attempted incorrect matching
- Example:
  ```
  Question Type: Matching pairs exercise
  Correct pairs:
    - Metal Halide ↔ High CRI (90+)
    - Incandescent ↔ CRI 100
    - LED ↔ Variable CRI
    - Fluorescent ↔ Low CRI (60-80)
  User's attempt: Matched items (see detailed response)
  ```

#### Hotspot Questions
- Shows what the user clicked on
- Indicates the correct target object(s)
- Example:
  ```
  Question Type: Visual identification (hotspot)
  Correct answer: Click on Apple with high CRI lighting
  User clicked: Apple under natural sunlight
  ```

#### Sequencing Questions
- Shows the correct sequence order
- Indicates user got the order wrong
- Example:
  ```
  Question Type: Sequence ordering
  Correct order:
    1. Measure ambient light temperature
    2. Select appropriate Kelvin setting
    3. Adjust white balance
    4. Fine-tune color compensation
  User's order: Incorrect sequence order
  ```

### 4. Prompt Section Always Included
- If user has wrong answers: Shows detailed mistakes
- If no wrong answers: Shows "RECENT MISTAKES: None found for this course"
- Ensures AI always knows the user's performance status

## Implementation Details

### Data Flow
1. User answers question → Stored in `user_question_responses` table
2. Enhanced recommendations fetches wrong answers with full question context
3. `prepareUserDataAnalysis` formats mistakes for human-readable display
4. `buildFinalSelectionPrompt` creates structured data for AI processing
5. AI receives full context including question, options, user answer, correct answer, and explanation

### Key Functions Updated
- `getWrongQuestionsFromCourse`: Fetches wrong answers with question details
- `prepareUserDataAnalysis`: Formats wrong answers for prompt display
- `buildFinalSelectionPrompt`: Structures data for AI selection

## Testing
Created comprehensive test scripts:
- `test-user-performance-data.js`: Verifies performance data retrieval
- `test-wrong-questions-for-course.js`: Tests wrong question fetching for specific courses
- `test-recommendations-with-wrong-questions.js`: End-to-end test of recommendations with mistakes

## Result
The enhanced recommendations system now provides full context about user mistakes, enabling more targeted video suggestions that address specific knowledge gaps. 

### Outcome Summary

1. **Wrong questions now successfully loaded** - Fixed multiple issues preventing data from reaching AI
2. **AI receives complete context** - Current course, user insights, and detailed mistake information
3. **All functions deployed** with comprehensive logging and debugging
4. **Prompts optimized** to emphasize mistake-specific recommendations

## Fix 3: Meaningful Mistake Descriptors (v3.2)

### Issue
The "Helps with:" section in the Next Course Modal was showing generic labels like "mistake 1, mistake 2" instead of meaningful descriptions of what the user got wrong.

### Root Cause
The AI prompt wasn't explicitly instructing the model to provide specific mistake descriptions in the `addresses_mistakes` array.

### Solution
Updated the `buildFinalSelectionPrompt` function to explicitly instruct the AI:
- DO NOT use generic labels like "mistake 1", "mistake 2"
- Instead, provide brief, specific descriptions of what the user got wrong
- Examples provided:
  - "Confused CRI with color temperature"
  - "Incorrectly matched light sources to CRI values"
  - "Clicked wrong apple in visual identification"
  - "Mixed up warm/cool color terminology"

### Implementation
```javascript
// In buildFinalSelectionPrompt
prompt += `
IMPORTANT: For the "addresses_mistakes" array:
- DO NOT use generic labels like "mistake 1", "mistake 2"
- Instead, provide brief, specific descriptions of what the user got wrong
- Examples:
  - "Confused CRI with color temperature"
  - "Incorrectly matched light sources to CRI values"
  - "Clicked wrong apple in visual identification"
  - "Mixed up warm/cool color terminology"
- Each entry should be a short phrase that clearly identifies the mistake
`;
```

### Result
The Next Course Modal now displays specific mistake descriptions that help users understand exactly what concepts the recommended video will help clarify.
